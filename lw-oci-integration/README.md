# Lacework OCI integration

This repository contains a terraform and shell script example of the creation of a cloud account integration policy for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

To use the shell script ensure you have `jq`, `oci` and `lacework` CLI commands available and working. Change directory to the bash folder and execute the following command:
```
./lacework_oci_integration_setup.sh
```

For Terraform refer to the [README.md](./terraform/README.md) in the Terraform directory.
